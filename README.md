# conf-42-basic-project

This is a very basic app built with native web components.

## The source

The main entry point for this application is src/app.mjs. This file will import all other needed files.

## The builds

I chose to show both a [rollup](https://rollupjs.org) and a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) build. The purpose here is to allow different setups to be demonstrated.

## Routing

[`@vaadin/router`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vaadin/router) is being used for the basic application routing. I am not demonstrating all of it's features, but you can [always go learn more!](https://vaadin.com/router).
